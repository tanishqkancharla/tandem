# How sync works

This page covers what happens between a `TandemClient` and its remote. The sync engine only runs when the client has a `remote`.

## Records and tuples

Each client stores records as ordered tuples: `["record", collection, ...idParts]`. A scalar ID contributes one part. A compound ID contributes each of its parts in order, so a transaction can scan by ID prefix.

## Mutations

`commit` turns a transaction into a mutation: an ID and a list of operations. The ID is a per-client counter: 1 for a client's first mutation, then one more for each commit.

```ts
type Mutation = {
	id: MutationId
	ops: (
		| { type: "set"; collection: string; value: Record }
		| { type: "remove"; collection: string; id: Id }
	)[]
}
```

A `set` carries the whole record, not a field-level diff. A `remove` is recorded even when the client doesn't have the record. Operations carry no previous value, because the client never undoes a mutation. See [Rebase](#rebase).

## Scan windows

A scan window is the list of queries the client currently subscribes to, encoded for the wire. `subscribe` adds a query, and `destroy` removes it. Each pull sends the scan window, and the remote returns only records inside it.

So a client does not receive another client's writes until it subscribes to a query that covers them. Calling `pullFromRemote()` runs a pull with the current scan window.

The same applies to a client's own writes. Once a pull confirms a write that no subscription covers, the record disappears locally, because the remote never sends it back.

## The sync loop

### Local write

1. `commit` applies the mutation to the local database right away.
2. Subscriptions re-run and the UI updates.
3. The mutation joins the list of pending mutations and is queued for push. For each record it writes that no pending mutation already writes, the client first saves the committed value as that record's base: the server's latest value as far as the client knows.

### Push

The sync engine batches queued pushes and pulls on an interval (`syncInterval`, 150 ms by default). A push sends pending mutations with the client ID:

```ts
await remote.push({ clientId, mutations })
```

If the push fails, the client drops that batch from its pending mutations and rebuilds their records from the base, and the `commit` promise rejects. While disconnected, the client skips pushes and sends pending mutations after `connect`.

### Pull

A pull asks for changes since the last cookie, limited to the scan window:

```ts
const { cookie, patch, lastMutationId } = await remote.pull({
	clientId,
	cookie,
	scanWindow,
})
```

- `patch` lists records to `set` and to `remove`.
- `cookie` is an opaque marker the client sends back on its next pull.
- `lastMutationId` is the last mutation from this client that the remote has applied, on every pull. It is `0` until the remote applies one.

### Poke

`connect` gives the remote a `poke` function. Calling it makes the client pull. The remote decides when to poke, for example over a WebSocket, SSE, or a polling timer.

### Rebase

The client applies each pull in one local transaction:

1. Apply the patch, and update the base of any record it mentions.
2. Drop pending mutations up to and including `lastMutationId`, since the remote has applied them. This happens even when the patch is empty.
3. Reset each record that has a base to its base value.
4. Re-apply the remaining pending mutations, one operation at a time, in order.

The client then forgets the base of records that no pending mutation writes. Subscribers see only the final state. Queries always read the optimistic value: the server's value with every pending mutation applied.

sequenceDiagram
	participant C as Client
	participant R as Remote
	C->>C: Apply mutation locally
	C->>R: push
	R->>R: Apply mutation
	R-->>C: poke
	C->>R: pull(cookie, scanWindow)
	R->>C: patch, cookie, lastMutationId
	C->>C: Apply patch, reset to base, replay pending
```

## Conflicts

Conflicts resolve as last write wins per record, in the order the remote applies pushes. Say clients A and B both edit todo `1`:

1. A sets `{ text: "Buy milk", complete: true }`.
2. B sets `{ text: "Buy oat milk", complete: false }`.
3. The remote applies A, then B. Its record is B's value.
4. After both clients pull and their mutations are acknowledged, both have B's value.

A's `complete: true` is lost because B's `set` replaced the whole record. Until A's pull acknowledges its mutation, A keeps replaying its own value on top of each patch.

## Client storage

With `clientStorage`, the client loads from storage on startup (`client.ready`) and writes changes back in batches (`clientStorageWriteInterval`, 120 ms by default). `flushClientStorage()` writes immediately.
