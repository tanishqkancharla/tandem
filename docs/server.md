# Server

`TandemServer` from `@tanishqkancharla/tandem-server` is a server-side Tandem database. It implements `RemoteApi`, so clients can sync against it, and it also exposes its own query and transaction API for server code.

## Create a server

`TandemServer` takes the same runtime schema and relations as the client, plus a storage adapter.

```ts
import {
	TandemServer,
	TandemServerJsonFileStorage,
} from "@tanishqkancharla/tandem-server"
import { schema, type TodoSchema } from "./schema"

const server = new TandemServer({
	schema,
	relations: {},
	storage: new TandemServerJsonFileStorage<TodoSchema>({
		filePath: "./data/tandem.json",
	}),
})
```

Call `server.close()` on shutdown to close storage.

## Connect clients

`TandemServer` has `connect`, `push`, and `pull` methods that match `RemoteApi`. Clients in the same process can use the server as their `remote` directly:

```ts
const client = new TandemClient({ schema, remote: server })
```

Across a network, the client's `remote` is a transport that forwards `push` and `pull` to the server and calls `poke` when there may be new data. The [Quickstart](quickstart.md#5-add-a-server) shows a minimal HTTP transport, and [`examples/todo`](../examples/todo) has a complete Hono server.

After every commit that writes data, the server pokes each connected client.

## Read and write on the server

Queries use the same object shape as the client (see [Queries](queries.md)), but return promises.

```ts
const todos = await server.query({
	collection: "todos",
	where: { complete: false },
})

const { result, destroy } = await server.subscribe(
	{ collection: "todos" },
	(todos) => console.log(todos),
	{ onError: (error) => console.error(error) },
)
```

Server transactions have async reads and sync writes. Commit them through the server so connected clients get poked.

```ts
const tx = server.transact()
const existing = await tx.get("todos", "welcome")
if (!existing) {
	tx.set("todos", {
		id: "welcome",
		text: "Build something",
		complete: false,
		createdAt: Date.now(),
	})
}
await server.commit(tx)
```

A transaction also has `list`, `scan`, `update`, `remove`, `query`, and `cancel`.

## Compound IDs

A record ID can be a tuple. Tandem stores its parts in order, and `scan` accepts a prefix of them.

```ts
import { collection, defineSchema } from "@tanishqkancharla/tandem-core"

type Entry = {
	id: readonly [sessionId: string, sequence: number]
	body: string
}

const schema = defineSchema({
	entries: collection<Entry>({ fields: ["id", "body"] }),
})

const tx = server.transact()
const sessionEntries = await tx.scan("entries", { prefix: ["session-1"] })
```

Client transactions support the same `scan` call.

## Storage

Storage adapters implement `TandemServerStorageApi`:

```ts
interface TandemServerStorageApi<Schema> {
	scan(args?: ScanStorageArgs): Promise<TandemTuple<Schema>[]>
	commit(writes: WriteOps<TandemTuple<Schema>>): Promise<void>
	close(): Promise<void>
}
```

`TandemServerJsonFileStorage` keeps tuples in memory and writes the whole file on each commit. It suits development and examples, not production.

## Limitations

- Records are durable when storage is durable. Sync metadata (revisions, acknowledged mutation IDs, client scan windows) lives in the server process and resets on restart.
- Pokes come from the `TandemServer` instance that committed the write. Writes made by other processes or directly to the database do not poke clients.
- The server does no authentication or authorization. Check requests in your transport before calling `push` or `pull`.
